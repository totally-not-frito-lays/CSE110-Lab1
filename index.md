## A little bit about me

I'm a student at UCSD working on finding some style because lets be honest, I don't have it yet. That `.css` file is still under iteration XD

Top 3 comic movies of all time:
1. Spiderman Enter the Spider-Verse
2. Avenger's Infinity War
3. Captain America Civil War

```JavaScript
while(alive) {
  live()
  learn()
  iterate()
 }
```
